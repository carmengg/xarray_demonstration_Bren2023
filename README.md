# Teaching Demonstration - Bren 2023

## üìö About

This repo contains materials for my teaching demo at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. 
This demo class covers basic concepts about the NetCDF data format and the Python package `xarray`. 

Main files in this repo:

- **xarray_demo.ipynb**:

    This is the notebook we will run. It has a mix of blank and populated code cells for demonstration purposes. We will use this notebook to create an `xarray.DataSet` based on the exercise we solved during the conceptual section of the class.
    
- **xarray_demo_BLANK.ipynb**

    Same as xarray_demo, but with no code written in it. We would use this notebook during a class for students to code along. 
    
- **xarray_demo_KEY.ipynb**

    Same as xarray_demo, but has all the code written in it. This kind of notebook with complete text and code would serve as notes for students. 

- **netcdf_demo_slides.pdf**

    These are the lecture slides for the portion of the teaching demo covering NetCDF (covered before going into the `xarray` notebook).
